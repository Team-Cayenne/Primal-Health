## Introduction
This project was a 1 week sprint in which our team attempted to complete a MVP for Rachel, the COO of Primal Health.  Primal Health's goal was an E-commerce site, focusing on biodynamically produced meal plan delivery subsciptions with an additional Nutrition and Health education resource.  Due to the short time constraints, our teams focus was on the profit revenue streaming component of the application, the food delivery aspect and its corresponding user story.

## Application Purpose
-The application allows users to access convienient and delicious meal kits through home delivery. The kits come complete with all you would need, gauranteeing the ingredients are organic, holistic high quality products sourced from vendors using biodynamic practices. Additionally, the application also has an educational aspect, providing users with nutritional information, inhouse nutritionist consultants, exercise and health resources and a daily health tracker.
-Primal Health was born out of a passionate desire to expose and engage local communities to a healthy lifestlye and community with local purveyors and health professionals.
